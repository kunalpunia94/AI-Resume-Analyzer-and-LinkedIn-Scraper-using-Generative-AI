      "\n",
      "**Gameplay**: Two teams of 11 players each take turns to bat and bowl. The objective is to score runs by hitting the ball and running between wickets.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Equipment**: The game requires a cricket bat, ball, wickets (three vertical stumps and two horizontal stumps), and protective gear like helmets and pads.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Types of deliveries**: The bowler delivers the ball in different ways, including fast balls, spin balls, and swing balls, which make it challenging for batsmen to hit.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Shots**: Batsmen play various shots, such as drives, cuts, pulls, and hooks, to score runs. The type of shot depends on the type of delivery and the batsman's skill.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Ways to get out**: A batsman can get out in several ways, including bowled (hit by the ball), lbw (leg before wicket), caught (hit by the ball and caught by a fielder), and stumped (hit by the ball while trying to score a run).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Innings**: Each team plays two innings, with a break in between. The team with the higher score at the end of both innings wins the match.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Variations**: There are several formats of cricket, including Test matches (longest and most traditional), One-Day Internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20 (T20) matches (short and fast-paced).\n",
      "\n",
      "**International competitions**: Cricket is played at international level, with teams representing their countries. The International Cricket Council (ICC) governs the sport and organizes major tournaments like the World Cup and Champions Trophy.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Popularity**: Cricket is extremely popular in many countries, including Australia, India, Pakistan, England, and the West Indies. It's a popular sport globally, with a huge fan base and a rich history.\n"
